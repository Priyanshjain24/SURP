** README FILE **

To test on any image run the "GUI.py" file and select the input image and output directory of the image.
The output Image will be saved as 'output.png' in the provided directory.
Datase used for training can be downloaded from: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/semantic-segmentation-of-aerial-imagery"

Files in the Folder and description:

1. README.txt :- Contains details about all the files and folders
2. GUI.py :- Python File to be run for selecting input test images and output directory and generating segmentation predictions on input test images.
3. run_model.py :- Python File for lading the trained model and predicting on test image
4. train.py :- Python file used for training the model
5. U-Net.hdf5 :- Trained model saved as '.hdf5' files
6. Outputs Folder :- Folder contains 20 images, each image has 3 images plotted: Image in the left is the Testing Image (satellite image), Image in the Middle is the Testing output, Image in the right is the prediction using the model.
7. Test Folder :- Contains 10 Images of 5 pairs (Input Image Format: 'Input_{index}.jpg', Prediction Format: 'Prediction_{index}.png'). These can be used to replicate and compare the results.
